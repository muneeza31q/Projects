Business Recommendations
I have been able to build a predictive model:

a) that the airline can deploy to identify customers' satisfaction.

b) that determines the key factors that will have an impact on customers' satisfaction and dissatisfaction.

Factors that have an impact on Customer Dissatisfaction: Online Boarding, Type of Travel, In-flight Wifi service.

Online boarding service should be the target customers for the airline - Customers who have easier online boarding experience or maybe even more online boarding options with additional help (like AI chat box or faster phone service), such customers have higher chances of satisfaction.

As for type of travel, Business travel has more customer satisfaction rating than Personal travel.

As for In-flight WiFi service, the better quality of WiFi service, the higher chances of customer satisfaction.

Departure and Arrival Convience had a positive correlation, which means that this factor contributed to customer satisfaction.
